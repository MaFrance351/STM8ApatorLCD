# STM8ApatorLCD
This code allows you to connect an LCD from the Apator Powogaz ELF-* to the STM8S103F3P6 MCU using Holtek HT1621B LCD driver.
The LCD pinout is provided so you can create and add your own segments and symbols, not only decimal numbers.
You need the STM8S_StdPeriph_Driver and STVD to compile this code.
